## Revonew 

Currency exchange marketplace-style app, intended for buying and selling of harder-to-find foreign currencies, avoiding large fees incurred by using traditional exchanges. Final project of the LeWagon fullstack web development course, which was designed and developed over two weeks in a 4-person team, and presented to the rest of the students on the demo day.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
