# Revonew 

Currency exchange marketplace-style app, intended for buying and selling of harder-to-find foreign currencies, avoiding large fees incurred by using traditional exchanges. Final project of the LeWagon fullstack web development course, which was designed and developed over two weeks in a 4-person team, and presented to the rest of the students on the demo day.

Still regularly updated by the team. 

## TODO
* Improve the real-time currency conversion functionality
* Add animated SVGs to the front page
* General improvements to front end for the rest of the site
